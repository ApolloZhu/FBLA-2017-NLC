# How to translate

Thank you for helping us translate our app. Here are a few tips for you.

## How do I open the file?

- If you have an editor for editing `xliff` file, use it. 
- If you want to find your own editor, google `xliff editor`
- If you have a mac, and don't have an editor preference, try this app: [https://itunes.apple.com/lv/app/xlifftool/id1074282695?mt=12](https://itunes.apple.com/lv/app/xlifftool/id1074282695?mt=12)
- Use online editor: [http://xliff.brightec.co.uk/](http://xliff.brightec.co.uk/) 


## Basic

Seeing weird note? Just ignore it.

You don't translate 0.4, leave it blank.

For `$(PRODUCT_NAME)`, use the same translation as `Charity Toaster`. That's the name for the app. If you have a better name for the it in you language, go ahead and use it. We are basically an app allowing donation of items and let others buy the donated items.


## Why I am seeing (〜￣△￣)〜 ?

Just copy and paste this as translation.

(〜￣△￣)〜

## What a **** is %f

It will be a decimal number.

## How about %1$@, %2$@...?

It will be a word. I provided what it will be in the comment, like `{location}`. Sometimes in your language you need to change orders of them, that is why we labeled them differently.

Let's look at an example usage:

||Source|Comment|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Original|Ship %1$@ to %2$@|Ship {item} to {user}|
|Translation|%2$@ will get %1$@|-|

## Any other problem?

Ask me.
