Mobile Application Development

## Installation Guide
Due to the closed nature of Apple and iOS, you are not able to install the compiled binary directly on your iOS devices. We strongly suggest to use the following method to download the app in to your iOS devices.

1. Get your iTunes account
2. Email the account to public-apollonian@outlook.com
3. You'll soon receive an email from TestFlight
4. Follow the instructions in that email

# Test Instruction
You may need an account to perform some actions. But don't worry, we'll prompt you to create one when needed. 
The process is pretty simple, as described below. 
We do have two sample accounts - text@example.com and test@example.com, both with password 123456
